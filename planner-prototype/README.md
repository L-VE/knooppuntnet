# Knooppuntnet planner prototype

This directory contains the code for a prototype of the routeplanner
functionality in knooppuntnet.

This code was developed by Ben Vandervorst in the context of his 
final year project work 2018/2019 (_Ondernemingsproject voorgedragen tot het behalen van het diploma
van Gegradueerde in de Informatica_). Many thanks to Ben for his
dedication and hard work to complete this project, and for contributing the
results to knooppuntnet! Thanks also to Koen Serneels and Mathy Paesen 
for supporting this project.
